## Generalized Character Recognition using K-nearest Neighbor

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a program that is capable of taking a handwritten character as
input and give an output of the characterâ€™s pure text equivalent. Upon successful execution of the
program, the team will research the alternative of using the program in the detection of other
languages and how difficult that implementation would be.
